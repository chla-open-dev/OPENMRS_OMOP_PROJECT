# OPENMRS_OMOP_PROJECT

Welcome to our OpenMRS-OMOP project! 

As more low and middle-income countries (LMICs) implement electronic health record systems (EHRs), informatics has become an important component of global health. OpenMRS is a popular open-source EHR that has been implemented in over 60 countries. As in high income countries, interoperability and research capabilities remain a challenge. The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) is one of the most relevant common data models (CDM) to support EHR-based research and data sharing, but its adoption has been limited in LMICs. To address this gap, we developed an OpenMRS to OMOP extract, transform, and load (ETL) tool using Talend. 
We built on existing documentation to develop a comprehensive concept map from OpenMRS to OMOP. The OMOP domains were reviewed for overlapping concepts in OpenMRS, and a core set of tables were selected for ETL development. Specific variables were then identified from OpenMRS tables which mapped to OMOP domain fields. Afterwards, the ETL tool was developed using MySQL Workbench, PostgreSQL, and Talend.   


We are a team of physicians, developers, and researchers at Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) named OPEN. For more information about our work, please visit www.learnwithopen.org & www.avetis.org. If you have any questions, our email is info@learnwithopen.org.
